# Variables and Variable Types

> Introduce Python variables and common value types.

WHY:
  Programs are built from values.
  Clear naming supports readable and maintainable code.

OBS:

  Familiarity develops through repeated use.

## What Is a Variable

In Python, a **variable** is a name that holds a value.

A variable associates a readable name with a piece of data so it can be reused, updated, and inspected throughout a program.


## Common Variable Types

Examples of common value types:

- `str` – holds text
- `int` – holds a whole number
- `float` – holds a decimal number
- `bool` – holds either `True` or `False` (capitalized)
- `list[T]` – ordered collections of values
- `dict[K, V]` – key/value mappings

OBS:
The letters inside square brackets (such as `T`, `K`, and `V`) are **type hints**.
They describe what kind of values the collection is expected to contain.


## Why Variables Come First

Variables are introduced early because:

- programs are composed of values
- data analysis depends on naming data clearly
- readable variables make intent visible


## Where Variables Are Used

Variables appear throughout Python programs, including:

- calculations
- logging output
- reading data from files
- building summaries of results

Clear variable names reduce confusion and improve code quality over time.
